"""1. Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print
the quote and the name of its author. Your output should look
something like the following, including the quotation marks:

Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never
tried anything new.”

Try using formatted strings with variables for the above task.


2. Concatenation: Assign a string to a variable, assign another string
to another variable and concatenate the 2 strings. NB: To concatenate
means to add two variables/strings together.

What is the expected behavior between the concatenation of a string

3. Read about the python ‘input()’ function and the python ‘len()’ function.

Here is a link to an article for the ‘input()’ function -
https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp

Here is a link to an article for the ‘len()’ function -
https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_len.asp

We will use these functions to build a simple program after this section.
